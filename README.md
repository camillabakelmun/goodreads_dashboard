Analyzing my Goodreads data to explore reading habits using Tableau.

Goodreads Reading Habits Dashboard
Introduction
This project explores my personal reading habits by analyzing Goodreads data from 2020 to 2024. Using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, and Tableau, I examined trends such as books read per year, average ratings, and total pages read. The centerpiece is an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes the data in an engaging way, combining my love for reading with my budding data analytics skills.

Steps Taken
Data Export & Cleaning

Exported my Goodreads data and imported it into Excel.
Cleaned the data by correcting errors, handling missing values, and removing unnecessary columns.
Added calculated columns such as the "age" of each book (years since publication).

Analysis

Created pivot tables in Google Sheets to summarize data:
Authors with the highest number of books read.
Yearly totals for books and pages read.
Comparison of my ratings versus average book ratings.
Calculated totals and averages for key metrics like ratings and pages read.

Visualization

Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard featuring:
Books read and pages read yearly.
A breakdown of my star ratings in a pie chart.
Ratings distribution scatterplot with a highlight on the oldest book.
Top authors by books read and total pages read.

Key Findings

Reading Volume: 2021 was my highest reading year where I read 75 books, which was 21,963 pages.
Total books: I've read a total of 214 books between 2020 and 2024, which totals 60,373 pages and total 164 authors.
Ratings: My average book rating is 3.8 stars, which is generally higher than the Goodreads average ratings.
Pages Read: I read the most pages in 2022, with a total of 15,000 pages.
Authors: My most read author is Taylor Jenkins Reid and I have read 8 of her books. All of which I've rated 4 or 5 stars.

Tools and Technologies Used

Excel: Data cleaning and preparation.
Google Sheets: Pivot tables for exploratory analysis.
Tableau: Creating visualizations and an interactive dashboard.

Challenges and Lessons Learned

Perfectionism: I spent a lot of time tweaking colors, borders, and layouts in Tableau. Balancing aesthetics with functionality was a learning experience.
Data Gaps: The lack of genre data limited my ability to analyze reading preferences by genre. Next time, I’d enrich my data with additional information.
Interactivity: Designing features like drop-down filters and interactive highlights was rewarding and made the dashboard more engaging.

Future Improvements

Add genre data to analyze trends in reading preferences.
Incorporate timelines or detailed heatmaps for deeper insights.
Explore predictions, such as estimating future reading trends based on past behavior.
